# TicTacToe-Project
.This Tic Tac Toe game, written in C++, allows players to compete against either another player or the computer. The game includes features like input validation, score tracking, and customizable game sessions. Players can choose between "X" and "O" symbols and take turns selecting board positions. The game checks for valid inputs and ensures the selected position is available. The logic to determine a winner is based on standard Tic Tac Toe rules, checking for rows, columns, or diagonal matches of the same symbol. If no winner is determined after all positions are filled, the game results in a draw. The game also tracks the number of wins for each player or the computer, and players can opt to play multiple rounds or reset the score. The use of object-oriented principles and functions enhances code readability and maintainability.
